# Authentication

Authentication and authorization is handled by Auth0.

You will have to inform a Bearer token in the requests in order to authenticate them.

```
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
Token generation mechanism is not available yet. Please check back later, as it's being developed.
{% endhint %}
