# How it was developed

The **Whoof API** is an ASP.NET Core Web API that is, or at least expected to be, always updated with the latest available .NET version.

All the development details are in the [GitHub repository's README](https://github.com/graduenz/whoof-aspnetcore/blob/main/README.md), and it's mostly updated there - please check it to see the whole stack, concepts, patterns, and tools used to build and run the project.
