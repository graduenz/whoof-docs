# How it was developed

The Whoof API is an ASP.NET Core Web API that is (expected to be) always updated with the last .NET version available.

All the details of development is at the [GitHub repository's README](https://github.com/graduenz/whoof-aspnetcore/blob/main/README.md), and it's only updated there - please check it to know the whole stack, concepts, and tools used to build and run the project.
